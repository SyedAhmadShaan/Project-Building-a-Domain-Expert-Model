*Project Introduction*

Imagine you are an AI engineer. Your team is exploring innovative ways to enhance customer experience and streamline information delivery. You've been entrusted by your boss to develop a proof of concept (POC) for a domain expert model. This model will be trained on a dataset of domain-specific knowledge (finance, medical, or IT domain knowledge). The model can then be used to create chat applications, internal knowledge applications, or text content generation for company collateral.

*Project Objective*

Your task in this project is to train (fine-tune) a large language model. This model should become a domain expert, capable of generating informative, accurate, and contextually relevant text responses. Think of it as creating a knowledgeable consultant for the company!

*The Challenge*

Selecting the Dataset: Choose an appropriate, copyright-free unstructured text dataset relevant to a domain. You'll choose from finance, medical, or IT datasets. This dataset will be the training ground for your model to learn domain-specific language and concepts.
