## Project Introduction
#### (Note: This project was part of the Udacity Introduction to Generative AI Course)
<p> Imagine you are an AI engineer. Your team is exploring innovative ways to enhance customer experience and streamline information delivery. You've been entrusted by your boss to develop a proof of concept (POC) for a domain expert model. This model will be trained on a dataset of domain-specific knowledge (finance, medical, or IT domain knowledge). The model can then be used to create chat applications, internal knowledge applications, or text content generation for company collateral. </p>

## Project Objective

<p> Your task in this project is to train (fine-tune) a large language model. This model should become a domain expert, capable of generating informative, accurate, and contextually relevant text responses. Think of it as creating a knowledgeable consultant for the company! </p>

## The Challenge

<p> Selecting the Dataset: Choose an appropriate, copyright-free unstructured text dataset relevant to a domain. You'll choose from finance, medical, or IT datasets. This dataset will be the training ground for your model to learn domain-specific language and concepts. </p>
